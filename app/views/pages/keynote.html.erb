		<h2>Case Example</h2>			

			<p>A 63 YO congressman developed severe DOE while skiing in Colorado and was found to have a Hgb of 7.4. Colonoscopy revealed a nearly obstructing fungating mass at 50 cm that was biopsy positive for a moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma. A CT scan showed mild emphysematous changes in her lungs and a single 1.5 cm RLL nodule along with at least 5 hepatic metastases with the largest measuring 3.4 cm involving the portal vein. Further pathologic evaluation reveals that her tumor is MSS and contains a glycine to arginine mutation in RAS codon 12.</p>

			<p>At this point, do you suggest systemic intervention using chemotherapy plus bevacizumab?</p>
